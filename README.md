# UnfollowInstagramBot
An Instagram bot using Selenium webdriver and InstagramAPI, written in Python.

For you to use, you will have to download the edgewebdriver (https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/) and you will need to install the Selenium and InstagramAPI package.

It works great for unfollowing people that doesn't follow you back. The code uses the sleep function a lot to prevent instagram to ban or something.
Feel free to download it, use it, report some bug and change anything you want!

P.s. There's some parts in the code that is written in portuguese, like click the button "agora n√£o", to work perfectly you might have to change those to your language.
